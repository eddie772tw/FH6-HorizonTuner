## 2024-05-24 - Pre-allocating Module-Level Arrays in 60Hz Render Loops
**Learning:** In high-frequency 60Hz telemetry HUD rendering loops, creating inline arrays like `var slipRatios = [a, b, c, d];` results in 240 arrays per second per wheel being created and discarded, increasing GC pressure and causing micro-stutters.
**Action:** Instead of dynamic arrays, pre-allocate module-scoped static arrays (e.g., `var _slipRatios = [0, 0, 0, 0];`) and mutate them by index (`_slipRatios[0] = a;`). Then, reassign the local variable to the pre-allocated array (`var slipRatios = _slipRatios;`).
## 2026-08-27 - DOM Element Caching in Render Loops
**Learning:** In high-frequency UI updates (like 60Hz telemetry overlays), calling `document.getElementById` repeatedly inside `onFrame` causes unnecessary CPU overhead and GC pressure.
**Action:** Always pre-query and cache DOM elements in a `domCache` structure during initialization instead of re-fetching them in the render loop.
